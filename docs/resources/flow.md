# flows_flow (Resource)

Creates and manages a Flow based on the provided definition in YAML format.

The easiest way to get started is to select a couple blocks through the Flows UI and then copy (via ctrl+c / cmd+c) them. You can then paste into a yaml file and use that as the definition.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "flows_flow" "example" {
  project_id = "your-project-id"
  name       = "My Flow"
  definition = file("${path.module}/flow.yaml")

  app_installation_mapping = {
    my_app = "app-installation-id"
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `definition` (String) YAML definition of the flow, easiest to obtain by copying blocks from the Flows UI.
- `name` (String) Name of the flow.
- `project_id` (String) ID of the project to create the flow in.

### Optional

- `app_installation_mapping` (Map of String) Mapping of app keys to app installation IDs to use when applying the flow definition. Can be used to specify installation ids when they are not provided in the yaml, or to override them.

### Read-Only

- `blocks` (Map of Object) Map of blocks in the flow, keyed by their names. Each block exposes its ID. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--blocks))
- `id` (String) ID of the flow.

<a id="nestedatt--blocks"></a>
### Nested Schema for `blocks`

Read-Only:

- `id` (String)

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
terraform import flows_flow.example $FLOW_ID
```
